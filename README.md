# hello-world-
It’s been many years since I’ve written code, around 1980. Restarting the journey 
I first heard about Bitcoin around 2009/10 I knew right away it would be something big. Unfortunantly I didnt listen to myself 
and I went on about my life till 2016 when I aquired a bit of bitcoin from cakecodes mobile app. Finally in october of 2017 I became emersed into crypto. I begin my new programming lessons here and now.
